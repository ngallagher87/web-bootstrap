web-bootstrap
=============

A simple webpage bootstrap (nothing fancy)

# What this contains

This contains some of the basic web stuff I like to have when starting projects:

1. `font-awesome` - (resides in css/`
2. `elements.less` - for all your mixin needs
3. `js easings` - for all you slick easing needs
4. `JQuery` - pretty basic, but it loads 1.9.1
5. `global less vars` - contains some helpful global vars to help in website layout
6. `Object literal js` - start off right by coding using object literals in your js scripts
7. `html5 shim` - don't forget that html5 shim!
8. `Google Web Fonts` - gives you ane asy spot to load your web fonts
  
This bootstrap just creates a healthy baseline to work from, and hopefully gets your projects started in the right direction.
